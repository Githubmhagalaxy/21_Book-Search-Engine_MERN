# 21_Book-Search-Engine_MERN

# Purpose:
Build a Google Books API search engine

# Description:
In this challenge, we take a fully functioning Google Books API search engine built with a RESTful API, and refactor it to be a GraphQL API built with Apollo Server. The app was built using the MERN stack, with a React front end, MongoDB database, and Node.js/Express.js server and API. It's already set up to allow users to save book searches to the back end.

# Built With:
